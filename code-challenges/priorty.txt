These are probably your top priority challenges. The last couple I'm not as sure about since I didn't take too much time looking them over, but the title makes me think they are likely good ones. 

I have included some insights, or "Spoiler hints". Of course learning requires struggle. So give them a try before you look at the "Spoiler hint" sections. If you get stuck for 10-15 minutes on something, for that challenges section unfold (click the little + sign in the margin) for Spoiler hints. None of them are answers. They are some insights on problem solving techniques that may help. 

objectketsobjectvalues (challenges 6)
  -- Spoiler hint: 
      Watch out for modifying the array. 
      If the array is modified by one function, is that going to mess up later functions? 
chaining (challenges 10}
  -- You should only need the array & string methods that came before this
  -- Spoiler hint: 
      For each section of code (aka how things after applying the method) 
      say to yourself "Now I have a ___ (a string, an integer, an object, an array of ___, etc)"
      also perhaps say to yourself a description of that that thing holds or represents. 
      for example: 
        let x = [
                  {name: 'Adrienne', skills: ['javascript', 'give IQ tests', 'social skills']}, 
                  {name: 'Jay', skills: ['saxophone', 'sodering', 'tube amps', 'video games']},
              ]
        x is an array of objects. 
        x[0] is a single object that has two keys of 'name' and 'skills'
        x[0].skills is an array of strings that represents things Adrienne has learned. 
        x[1].skills.join(' ') is a single string (of the skills) for the second object
        ... etc 

two-dimensional-arrays (challenges 12)
  -- Spoiler hints: 
     1) Thinking in a similar way as the hint for challenges 10 may be helpful. 
     2) If you need to have a for loop inside a for loop, solve the inside loop first. 
     Basically, ask how would I do this if it was only for the first element of 
     the big array? ... Okay, now how do I take that same code and do that for the rest?
